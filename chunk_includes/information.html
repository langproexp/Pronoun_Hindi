<li><p><strong>Research Project Title: Referential communication</strong></p></li>
<li><p><strong>Background, aims of project</strong></p></li>
</ol>
<ul>
<p>You're invited to take part in a study investigating how language users achieve successful communication verbally. We hope this will enhance our understanding of the processes that underlie language communication.</p>
</ul>
<ol start="3" type="1">
<li><p><strong>Why have I been invited to take part?</strong></p></li>
</ol>
<ul>
<p>You have been invited to participate because we want to understand how native speakers of English produce descriptions.</p>
</ul>
<ol start="4" type="1">
<li><p><strong>Do I have to take part?</strong></p></li>
</ol>
<ul>
<p>No, you don't have to take part, and participation in this study is voluntary. You may withdraw from this study at any time without giving a reason and without getting any penalty. To do this, you can simply close the browser window. If you do withdraw, we will not collect any more data from you. If you wish your data to be removed, you must email Kumiko Fukumura (<span class="underline"><a href="mailto:kumiko.fukumura@stir.ac.uk">kumiko.fukumura@stir.ac.uk</a>.</span>) within 7 days of participating in the study.</p>
</ul>
<ol start="5" type="1">
<li><p><strong>What will happen if I take part?</strong></p></li>
</ol>
<ul>
<p>Before participation, you will be asked to confirm your age, current education status, aspects of your vision, language background and gender. In the study, you will describe common characters/objects shown in a series of visual displays. Your descriptions of objects will be audio-recorded. The experiment takes approximately 25-30 minutes.</p>
</ul>
<ol start="6" type="1">
<li><p><strong>Are there any potential risks in taking part?</strong></p></li>
</ol>
<ul>
<p>There is no known risk involved in this study.</p>
</ul>
<ol start="7" type="1">
<li><p><strong>Are there any benefits in taking part?</strong></p></li>
</ol>
<ul>
<p>There will be no immediate benefits to you but your participation will help us understand how people use language in communication. If you are taking part in this study through Psychweb (University of Stirling Psychology Course Credit System), you will receive 0.5 tokens.</p>
</ul>
<ol start="8" type="1">
<li><p><strong>What happens to the data I provide?</strong></p></li>
</ol>
<ul>
<p>Your research data will be anonymised using coded identifiers that are only known to the research team. The coding scheme will be destroyed after data collection has concluded.</p>
</ul>
<ol start="9" type="1">
<li><p><strong>Analyses</strong></p></li>
</ol>
<ul>
<p>We will analyse participants' descriptions. Only the research team will have access to the anonymised responses.</p>
</ul>
<ol start="10" type="1">
<li><p><strong>Future uses of the data</strong></p></li>
</ol>
<ul>
<p>Due to the nature of this research, it is very likely that other researchers may find the data useful in answering other research questions. We will ask for your explicit consent for your anonymised responses to be kept for a minimum of 10 years and shared in this way and we will ensure that the data collected is untraceable back to you before letting others use it.</p>
</ul>
<ol start="11" type="1">
<li><p><strong>Will the research be published?</strong></p></li>
</ol>
<ul>
<p>The findings from this research will be published in journals and conference proceedings. You will not be identifiable in any report or publication. The University of Stirling is committed to making the outputs of research publicly accessible and supports this commitment through our online open access repository STORRE. Unless publisher requirements prevent us this research will be publicly disseminated through our open access repository.</p>
